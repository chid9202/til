## OCT 7
- It's good to name variables according to data essence rather than followed by designs.
- Naming from design (or front-end) may vary by pages, but the data doesn't

## OCT 4

- From macOS + git > when only case of filename is changed, git won't notice. e.g. `./component/NavBar` > `./component/navBar`, git won't see difference.
- Therefore, you rename file on mac, it won't create error when you build. But when you try to deploy on AWS Amplify, since it's building from Linux, it generates error which they can't file the corresponding file!
