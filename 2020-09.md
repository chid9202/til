- typescript - name class `Props` including class name like `ButtonProps`,
  - so when the props is inherited to other component which includes multiple Props, it won't have duplicated Prop variable name.
  - Because you don't want to change the imported variable name like `import { Props as ButtonProps} ...` which will increase complexity!
- typescript - defining type of inheriting destruction

```ts
const renderItem = ({ item }: { item: ChatItemProps }) => (
    <ChatItem
      contactName={item.contactName}
      avatar={item.avatar}
      date={item.date}
      message={item.message}
      isRead={item.isRead}
    />
  );
```
