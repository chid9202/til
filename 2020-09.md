- typescript - name class `Props` including class name like `ButtonProps`,
  - so when the props is inherited to other component which includes multiple Props, it won't have duplicated Prop variable name.
  - Because you don't want to change the imported variable name like `import { Props as ButtonProps} ...` which will increase complexity!
- typescript - defining type of inheriting destruction

```ts
const renderItem = ({ item }: { item: ChatItemProps }) => (
  <ChatItem
    contactName={item.contactName}
    avatar={item.avatar}
    date={item.date}
    message={item.message}
    isRead={item.isRead}
  />
);
```
